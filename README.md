# Description

>
Pуthоn iѕ a high-level programming lаnguаgе. It iѕ quite еаѕу tо lеаrn аnd more powerful thаn оthеr programming lаnguаgеѕ because оf its dуnаmiс style and simple ѕуntаx whiсh аllоws for ѕmаll lines оf соdе. Python can be used to develop just about any type of programming project you can think of. When you understand how to program in Python, you unlock a new world of computing power and endless possibilities.

1. ## Creating a Dictionary

>
In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.

Note – Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.

 >
Dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing to curly braces{}.

2. ## Adding elements to a Dictionary

>
 Python Dictionary, Addition of elements can be done in multiple ways. One value at a time can be added to a Dictionary by defining value along with the key e.g. Dict[Key] = ‘Value’. Updating an existing value in a Dictionary can be done by using the built-in update() method. Nested key values can also be added to an existing Dictionary.
Note- While adding a value, if the key value already exists, the value gets updated otherwise a new Key with the value is added to the Dictionary.
