1. ## Creating a Dictionary

>
In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.

Note – Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.

 >
Dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing to curly braces{}.

2. ## Adding elements to a Dictionary

>
 Python Dictionary, Addition of elements can be done in multiple ways. One value at a time can be added to a Dictionary by defining value along with the key e.g. Dict[Key] = ‘Value’. Updating an existing value in a Dictionary can be done by using the built-in update() method. Nested key values can also be added to an existing Dictionary.
Note- While adding a value, if the key value already exists, the value gets updated otherwise a new Key with the value is added to the Dictionary.

2. ## Accessing elements from a Dictionary

>
In order to access the items of a dictionary refer to its key name.Key can be used inside square brackets.

[Go to the Source Code](https://github.com/Ramovha/leetcode/blob/main/Basic/pythonDictionary4.ipynb)

There is also a method called get() that will also help in acessing the element from a dictionary.

3. ## Accessing element of a nested dictionary

>
In order to access the value of any key in nested dictionary, use indexing [] syntax.

---

4. ## Removing Elements from Dictionary

>
Using del keyword
In Python Dictionary, deletion of keys can be done by using the del keyword. Using del keyword, specific values from a dictionary as well as whole dictionary can be deleted. Items in a Nested dictionary can also be deleted by using del keyword and providing specific nested key and particular key to be deleted from that nested Dictionary.

Note- del Dict will delete the entire dictionary and hence printing it after deletion will raise an Error.

5. ## Using pop() method, popitem() method and clear() method

>
Pop() method is used to return and delete the value of the key specified.
>
The popitem() returns and removes an arbitrary element (key, value) pair from the dictionary
>
All the items from a dictionary can be deleted at once by using clear() method.

6. ## Dictionary Methods
>
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.

Method      Description
- clear() ===>Removes all the elements from the dictionary e
- copy() ====>Returns a copy of the dictionary
- fromkeys()===>Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and values
- get() ====>Returns the value of the specified key
- items()====>Returns a list containing the a tuple for each key value pair
- keys() ====>Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
- pop()=====>Removes the element with the specified key
- popitem()====>Removes the last inserted key-value pair
- setdefault()====>Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not - exist: insert the key, with the specified value
- update()====>Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs
- values()====>Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
